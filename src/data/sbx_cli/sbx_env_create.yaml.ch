name: sbx env create
synopsis: Create a sandbox environment from sbxenv.yaml
experimental: true
description: |-
    Read the environment file from PATH (default: current directory),
    provision its declared secrets at the sandbox scope, merge its credential
    bindings, and create the sandbox. Use "sbx env run" to attach.

@x
    Each PATH may be a directory (the file is <PATH>/sbxenv.yaml) or the
    path to the environment file itself. Passing more than one PATH deep-merges them
    in order (docker-compose `-f` semantics): later files override earlier ones.
    Values may reference the arguments the file declares with ${{ env.args.NAME }},
    supplied by --env-arg, plus ${{ env.projectDir }} and ${{ env.fileDir }}.
    Nothing else is expanded, so a "$" is literal text.

@x
    A directory PATH selects sbxenv.yaml; a file PATH selects that file.
    With no PATH, ~/.sbxenv.yaml supplies shared defaults when present.
    Explicit PATHs skip those defaults. Later files override earlier values;
    lists such as ports and mcp.servers are concatenated.

@x name
      usage: |
        Name for the sandbox, overriding 'name:' in sbxenv.yaml and the derived <agent>-<directory> (every 'sbx env' command addressing this environment needs the same value)

@x
    - name: on-timeout
      usage: |
        What happens when --ttl lapses: 'stop' stops the sandbox in place so it can be started again later, 'restart' keeps it running by stopping and immediately starting it, or 'delete' removes it. Omit the flag and the server stops the sandbox when it can be started again later, and deletes it otherwise. With 'restart' a supplied --ttl must be at least 1h (cloud only). Only applies when the sandbox is created; 'sbx --cloud env run' refuses it when attaching to an existing one.
