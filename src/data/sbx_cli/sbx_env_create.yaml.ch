name: sbx env create
synopsis: Create a sandbox environment from sbxenv.yaml
experimental: true
description: |-
    Read the environment file from PATH (default: current directory),
    provision its declared secrets at the sandbox scope, merge its credential
    bindings, and create the sandbox. Use "sbx env run" to attach.

    Each PATH may be a directory (the file is <PATH>/sbxenv.yaml) or the
    path to the environment file itself. Passing more than one PATH deep-merges them
    in order (docker-compose `-f` semantics): later files override earlier ones.
    Values may reference the arguments the file declares with ${{ env.args.NAME }},
    supplied by --env-arg, plus ${{ env.projectDir }} and ${{ env.fileDir }}.
    Nothing else is expanded, so a "$" is literal text.

    A directory resolves to the sbxenv.yaml in it and to no other name; any
    other file is read only when a PATH names it. The hidden .sbxenv.yaml was once
    read as a directory's own environment too, so a project still holding one now
    reads as having none.

@x
    With no PATH, an existing .sbxenv.yaml in your home directory is merged
    underneath as a base layer for defaults shared across projects; naming any
    PATH skips the layer. It may not set "name:", which identifies a single
    project, and its "workspace:" must be rooted at ${{ env.projectDir }} — for
    the base that is always the directory the invocation runs from, since naming
    any PATH skips it — so the base mounts each project's own directory rather
    than one directory under all of them. Changing its "agent:"
    changes the derived <agent>-<directory-basename> sandbox name, leaving
    sandboxes created under the previous name for "sbx env rm" to miss.

@x
    A list such as "ports" or "mcp.servers" concatenates across layers rather
    than overriding, so an entry declared in both appears twice.
