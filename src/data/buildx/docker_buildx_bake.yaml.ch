    Entitlements are designed to provide controlled access to privileged
    operations. By default, Buildx and BuildKit operates with restricted
    permissions to protect users and their systems from unintended side effects or
    security risks. The `--allow` flag explicitly grants access to additional
    entitlements, making it clear when a build or bake operation requires elevated
    privileges.

    In addition to BuildKit's `network.host` and `security.insecure` entitlements
    (see [`docker buildx build --allow`](/reference/cli/docker/buildx/build/#allow),
    Bake supports file system entitlements that grant granular control over file
    system access. These are particularly useful when working with builds that need
    access to files outside the default working directory.
