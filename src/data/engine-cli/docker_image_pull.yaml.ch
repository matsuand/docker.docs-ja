    Docker uses a content-addressable image store, and the image ID is a SHA256
    digest covering the image's configuration and layers. In the example above,
    `debian:bookworm` and `debian:latest` have the same image ID because they are
    the same image tagged with different names. Because they are the same image,
    their layers are stored only once and do not consume extra disk space.

    So far, you've pulled images by their name (and "tag"). Using names and tags is
    a convenient way to work with images. When using tags, you can `docker pull` an
    image again to make sure you have the most up-to-date version of that image.
    For example, `docker pull ubuntu:24.04` pulls the latest version of the Ubuntu
    24.04 image.

@x
    In some cases you don't want images to be updated to newer versions, but prefer
    to use a fixed version of an image. Docker enables you to pull an image by its
    digest. When pulling an image by digest, you specify exactly which version
    of an image to pull. Doing so, allows you to "pin" an image to that version,
    and guarantee that the image you're using is always the same.

    By default, `docker pull` pulls images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com). It is also possible to
    manually specify the path of a registry to pull from. For example, if you have
    set up a local registry, you can specify its path to pull from it. A registry
    path is similar to a URL, but does not contain a protocol specifier (`https://`).
