    The `--platform` option allows you to specify which platform variant of the
    image to save. By default, `docker save` saves all platform variants that
    are present in the daemon's image store. Use the `--platform` option
    to specify which platform variant of the image to save. An error is produced
    if the given platform is not present in the local image store.

@x
    The platform option takes the `os[/arch[/variant]]` format; for example,
    `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64/v8`. Architecture and variant are optional,
    and default to the daemon's native architecture if omitted.
