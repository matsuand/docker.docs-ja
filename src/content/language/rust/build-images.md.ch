This guide walks you through building your first Rust image. An image
includes everything needed to run an application - the code or binary, runtime,
dependencies, and any other file system objects required.

Now that you have an application, you can use `docker init` to create a
Dockerfile for it. Inside the `docker-rust-hello` directory, run the `docker
init` command. `docker init` provides some default configuration, but you'll
need to answer a few questions about your application. Refer to the following
example to answer the prompts from `docker init` and use the same answers for
your prompts.

When you run `docker init`, it also creates a [`.dockerignore`](../../engine/reference/builder.md#dockerignore-file) file. Use the `.dockerignore` file to specify patterns and paths that you don't want copied into the image in order to keep the image as small as possible. Open up the `.dockerignore` file in your favorite IDE or text editor and see what's inside already.

Now that youâ€™ve created the Dockerfile, you can build the image. To do this, use
the `docker build` command. The `docker build` command builds Docker images from
a Dockerfile and a context. A build's context is the set of files located in
the specified PATH or URL. The Docker build process can access any of the files
located in this context.
