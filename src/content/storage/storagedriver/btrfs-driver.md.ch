Docker's `btrfs` storage driver leverages many Btrfs features for image and
container management. Among these features are block-level operations, thin
provisioning, copy-on-write snapshots, and ease of administration. You can
combine multiple physical block devices into a single Btrfs filesystem.

Information about image layers and writable container layers is stored in
`/var/lib/docker/btrfs/subvolumes/`. This subdirectory contains one directory
per image or container layer, with the unified filesystem built from a layer
plus all its parent layers. Subvolumes are natively copy-on-write and have space
allocated to them on-demand from an underlying storage pool. They can also be
nested and snapshotted. The diagram below shows 4 subvolumes. 'Subvolume 2' and
'Subvolume 3' are nested, whereas 'Subvolume 4' shows its own internal directory
tree.

Writing a new file to a container invokes an allocate-on-demand operation to
allocate new data block to the container's snapshot. The file is then written
to this new space. The allocate-on-demand operation is native to all writes
with Btrfs and is the same as writing new data to a subvolume. As a result,
writing new files to a container's snapshot operates at native Btrfs speeds.

Updating an existing file in a container is a copy-on-write operation
(redirect-on-write is the Btrfs terminology). The original data is read from
the layer where the file currently exists, and only the modified blocks are
written into the container's writable layer. Next, the Btrfs driver updates the
filesystem metadata in the snapshot to point to this new data. This behavior
incurs minor overhead.
