Ideally, very little data is written to a container's writable layer, and you
use Docker volumes to write data. However, some workloads require you to be able
to write to the container's writable layer. This is where storage drivers come
in.

Docker supports several storage drivers, using a pluggable architecture. The
storage driver controls how images and containers are stored and managed on your
Docker host. After you have read the [storage driver overview](index.md), the
next step is to choose the best storage driver for your workloads. Use the storage
driver with the best overall performance and stability in the most usual scenarios.

| `overlay2`         | `overlay2` is the preferred storage driver for all currently supported Linux distributions, and requires no extra configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `fuse-overlayfs`   | `fuse-overlayfs`is preferred only for running Rootless Docker on a host that does not provide support for rootless `overlay2`. On Ubuntu and Debian 10, the `fuse-overlayfs` driver does not need to be used, and `overlay2` works even in rootless mode. Refer to the [rootless mode documentation](../../engine/security/rootless.md) for details.                                                            |
| `btrfs` and `zfs`  | The `btrfs` and `zfs` storage drivers allow for advanced options, such as creating "snapshots", but require more maintenance and setup. Each of these relies on the backing filesystem being configured correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `vfs`              | The `vfs` storage driver is intended for testing purposes, and for situations where no copy-on-write filesystem can be used. Performance of this storage driver is poor, and is not generally recommended for production use.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `devicemapper` ([deprecated](../../../engine/deprecated.md#device-mapper-storage-driver)) | The `devicemapper` storage driver requires `direct-lvm` for production environments, because `loopback-lvm`, while zero-configuration, has very poor performance. `devicemapper` was the recommended storage driver for CentOS and RHEL, as their kernel version did not support `overlay2`. However, current versions of CentOS and RHEL now have support for `overlay2`, which is now the recommended driver. |

packages to be installed, while `btrfs` is only supported if your system uses

If your enterprise uses SAN, NAS, hardware RAID, or other shared storage
