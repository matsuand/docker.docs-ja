In [part 5](./05_persisting_data.md), you used a volume mount to persist the
data in your database. A volume mount is a great choice when you need somewhere
persistent to store your application data.

A bind mount is another type of mount, which lets you share a directory from the
host's filesystem into the container. When working on an application, you can
use a bind mount to mount source code into the container. The container sees the
changes you make to the code immediately, as soon as you save a file. This means
that you can run processes in the container that watch for filesystem changes
and respond to them.

In this chapter, you'll see how you can use bind mounts and a tool called
[nodemon](https://npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to watch for file changes, and then restart the application
automatically. There are equivalent tools in most other languages and
frameworks.

2. Refresh the page in your web browser, and you should see the change reflected
   almost immediately because of the bind mount. Nodemon detects the change and
   restarts the server. It might take a few seconds for the Node server to
   restart. If you get an error, try refreshing after a few seconds.

In order to prepare your app for production, you need to migrate your database
from working in SQLite to something that can scale a little better. For
simplicity, you'll keep using a relational database and switch your application
to use MySQL. But, how should you run MySQL? How do you allow the containers to
talk to each other? You'll learn about that in the next section.
