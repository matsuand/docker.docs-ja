When a Docker container starts, it executes an application or command. The container gets this executable (script or file) from its image’s configuration. Containers come with default settings that usually work well, but you can change them if needed. These adjustments help the container's program run exactly how you want it to.

For example, if you have an existing database container that listens on the standard port and you want to run a new instance of the same database container, then you might want to change the port settings the new container listens on so that it doesn’t conflict with the existing container. Sometimes you might want to increase the memory available to the container if the program needs more resources to handle a heavy workload or set the environment variables to provide specific configuration details the program needs to function properly.

By default, containers automatically connect to a special network called a bridge network when you run them. This bridge network acts like a virtual bridge, allowing containers on the same host to communicate with each other while keeping them isolated from the outside world and other hosts. It's a convenient starting point for most container interactions. However, for specific scenarios, you might want more control over the network configuration.
