* Bug fixes and minor changes
  - AUFS storage driver is deprecated in Docker Desktop and AUFS support will be removed in the next major release. You can continue with AUFS in Docker Desktop 18.06.x, but you will need to reset the disk image (in Settings > Reset menu) before updating to the next major update. You can check documentation to [save images](/engine/reference/commandline/save/#examples) and [backup volumes](../../storage/volumes.md#back-up-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes)
  - Fix bug which would in some cases cause virtual machine logs to be written to RAM rather than disk, and the virtual machine to hang.
  - Fix security issue with named pipe connection to docker service.
  - Fix VPNKit memory leak. Fixes [docker/for-win#2087](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/2087), [moby/vpnkit#371](https://github.com/moby/vpnkit/issues/371)
  - Fix restart issue when using Windows fast startup on latest 1709 Windows updates. Fixes [docker/for-win#1741](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1741), [docker/for-win#1741](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1741)

  - Fix broken link in diagnostics window.
  - Added log rotation for docker-ce logs inside the virtual machine.
  - Changed smb permission to avoid issue when trying to manipulate files with different users in containers. Fixes [docker/for-win#2170](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/2170)

  - DNS name `host.docker.internal` should be used for host resolution from containers. Older aliases (still valid) are deprecated in favor of this one. (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-let-localhost-be-localhost-06).
  - Fix for the HTTP/S transparent proxy when using "localhost" names (for example, `host.docker.internal`). Fixes [docker/for-win#1130](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1130)
