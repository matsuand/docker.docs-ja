- Fixed a possible file sharing error where a file may appear to have the wrong size in a container when it is modified on the host. This is a partial fix for [docker/for-mac#4999](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4999).
- Removed unnecessary log messages which slow down filesystem event injection.

- When sharing Linux directories (`/var`, `/bin`, etc) with containers, Docker Desktop avoids watching paths in the host file system.
- When sharing a file into a container (e.g. `docker run -v ~/.gitconfig`) Docker Desktop does not watch the parent directory. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4981](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4981).
- gRPC FUSE: fix `chown` when the file is read-only. Fixes `rabbitmq`, see [docker/for-mac#4964](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4964).
- gRPC FUSE: generate `ATTRIB` inotify events as well as `MODIFY`. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4962](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4962).
- gRPC FUSE: return `EOPNOTSUPP` from `fallocate` for unsupported modes. Fixes `minio`. See [docker/for-mac#4964](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4964).
- Fixed an issue related to NFS mounting. See [docker/for-mac#4958](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4958).
- Always flush file system caches synchronously on container start. See [docker/for-mac#4943](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4943).
- Allow symlinks to point outside of shared volumes. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4862](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4862).
- Diagnostics: avoid hanging when Kubernetes is in a broken state.
- Fixed automatic start on log in. See [docker/for-mac#4877](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4877) and [docker/for-mac#4890](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4890).

- Fixed the VM debug shell used for low-level debugging.
- Fixed compatibility with Go 1.15 clients. See [docker/for-mac#4855](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4855).

- Fixed a Mac CPU usage bug by removing the serial console from `hyperkit`, see [docker/roadmap#12]( https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/12#issuecomment-663163280). To open a shell in the VM use either `nc -U ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/debug-shell.sock` (on Mac) or `putty -serial \\.\pipe\dockerDebugShell` (on Windows).

- Fixed an issue with startup when the Kubernetes certificates have expired. See [docker/for-mac#4594](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4594).
- Fixed `hyperkit` on newer Macs / newer versions of `Hypervisor.framework`.
- Added support for the global Mutagen config file `~/.mutagen.yml`.
- Automatically set up a two-way file sync using `:delegated` option with `docker run -v` command.
- Re-added device-mapper to the embedded Linux kernel. See [docker/for-mac#4549](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4549).
- Improved diagnostics when using two-way synchronization with the Mutagen cache.
- Switched to Mutagen `posix-raw` symlink mode which fixes cases where the symlinks point outside the synchronized directory. See [docker/for-mac#4595](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4595).
- Removed the legacy Kubernetes context `docker-for-desktop`. The context `docker-desktop` should be used instead. See [docker/for-mac#4089](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4089).

- Reduced the size of the Docker Desktop installer from 710 MB to 445 MB.
- Removed dangling `/usr/local/bin/docker-machine` symlinks which avoids custom installs of `docker-machine` being accidentally deleted in future upgrades. Note that if you have installed Docker Machine manually, then the install might have followed the symlink and installed Docker Machine in `/Applications/Docker.app`. In this case, you must manually reinstall Docker Machine after installing this version of Docker Desktop. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4208](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4208).
- Fixed a bug where the Docker UI could be started without the engine.
- Switched from `ahci-hd` to `virtio-blk` to avoid an AHCI deadlock, see [moby/hyperkit#94](https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/issues/94) and [docker/for-mac#1835](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1835).
- Capturing diagnostics is now faster and easier.
- Fixed an issue where a container port could not be exposed on a specific host IP. See [docker/for-mac#4209](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4209).
- Kubernetes: Persistent volumes created by claims are now stored in the virtual machine. Fixes [docker/for-win#5665](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5665).
- Removed port probing from dashboard, just unconditionally showing links to ports that should be available. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4264](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4264).

* New
  - Docker Desktop includes the `buildx` plugin (currently experimental).
  - Selecting the `Experimental features` checkbox on the Docker Desktop Preferences Daemon page enables experimental features in the  Docker daemon and the Docker CLI.
  - Docker Desktop has improved the reliability of `com.docker.osxfs trace` performance profiling command.
  - Users can now run the `com.docker.osxfs trace --summary` option to get a high-level summary of operations, instead of receiving a trace of all operations.
  - Docker Desktop now supports large lists of DNS resource records on Mac. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2160](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2160#issuecomment-431571031)

* Bug fixes and minor changes
  - Docker Desktop does not send DNS queries for `docker-desktop.<domain>` every 10s. It now relies on the host's DNS domain search order rather than trying to replicate it inside the VM.
  - Docker Desktop has removed the ability to log in using email address as a username as the Docker command line does not support this.
  - Docker Desktop now allows running a Docker registry inside a container. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3611](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3611)
  - Fixed a stability issue with the DNS resolver.

  - Kubernetes Load balanced services are no longer marked as `Pending`.
  - Fix hostPath mounts in Kubernetes.
  - Update Compose on Kubernetes to v0.3.0 rc4. Existing Kubernetes stacks will be removed during migration and need to be re-deployed on the cluster.

  - Allow individual IP addresses to be added to HTTP proxy excludes.
  - Avoid hitting DNS timeouts when querying docker.for.mac.* when the upstream DNS servers are slow or missing.
  - Fix for `docker push` to an insecure registry. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2392](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2392)
  - Separate internal ports used to proxy HTTP and HTTPS content.
  - If kubectl was already installed before Docker For Mac, restore the existing kubectl when sitching Kubernetes off in Docker for Mac.
  - Migration of Docker Toolbox images is not proposed anymore in Docker For Mac installer (still possible to migrate Toolbox images manually).

  - Experimental Kubernetes Support. You can now run a single-node Kubernetes cluster from the "Kubernetes" Pane in Docker For Mac Preferences and use kubectl commands as well as docker commands. See [the Kubernetes section](../kubernetes.md)
  - DNS name `docker.for.mac.host.internal` should be used instead of `docker.for.mac.localhost` (still valid) for host resolution from containers, since since there is an RFC banning the use of subdomains of localhost (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-let-localhost-be-localhost-06).

  - For systems running APFS on SSD on High Sierra, use `raw` format virtual machine disks by default. This increases disk throughput (from 320MiB/sec to 600MiB/sec in `dd` on a 2015 MacBook Pro) and disk space handling.
  Existing disks are kept in qcow format, if you want to switch to raw format you need to "Reset to factory defaults". To query the space usage of the file, use a command like:
  `$ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/`
  `$ ls -ls Docker.raw`
  `3944768 -rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff  68719476736 Nov 16 11:19 Docker.raw`
  The first number (`3944768`) is the allocated space in blocks; the larger number `68719476736` is the maximum total amount of space the file may consume in future in bytes.

* Fixed an issue where some windows did not claim focus correctly
* Added UI when switching channel to prevent user losing containers and settings
* Check disk capacity before Toolbox import
* Import certificates in `etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

* `osxfs`: Enabled 10ms dcache for 3x speedup on a `go list ./...` test against docker/machine. Workloads heavy in file system path resolution (common among dynamic languages and build systems) will have those resolutions performed in amortized constant time rather than time linear in the depth of the path so speedups of 2-10x will be common.
