CVEs are publicly disclosed cybersecurity flaws in software or hardware. Each
CVE is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., CVE-2024-12345) and includes a
standardized description, allowing organizations to track and address
vulnerabilities consistently.

@x
In the context of Docker, CVEs often pertain to issues within base images, or
application dependencies. These vulnerabilities can range from minor bugs to
critical security risks, such as remote code execution or privilege escalation.

- Unauthorized access: Exploits can grant attackers unauthorized access to
  systems.
- Data breaches: Sensitive information can be exposed or stolen.
- Service disruptions: Vulnerabilities can be leveraged to disrupt services or
  cause downtime.
- Compliance violations: Failure to address known vulnerabilities can lead to
  non-compliance with industry regulations and standards.

CVE mitigation:
@z

@x
- Reduced attack surface: DHIs are built using a distroless approach, stripping
  away unnecessary components and packages. This reduction in image size, up to
  95% smaller than traditional images, limits the number of potential
  vulnerabilities, making it harder for attackers to exploit unneeded software.

@x
- Faster CVE remediation: Maintained by Docker with an enterprise-grade SLA,
  DHIs are continuously updated to address known vulnerabilities. Critical and
  high-severity CVEs are patched quickly, ensuring that your containers remain
  secure without manual intervention.

- Proactive vulnerability management: By utilizing DHIs, organizations can
  proactively manage vulnerabilities. The images come with CVE and Vulnerability
  Exposure (VEX) feeds, enabling teams to stay informed about potential threats
  and take necessary actions promptly.

Regularly scanning Docker images for CVEs is essential for maintaining a secure
containerized environment. While Docker Scout is integrated into Docker Desktop
and the Docker CLI, tools like Grype and Trivy offer alternative scanning
capabilities. The following are instructions for using each tool to scan Docker
images for CVEs.
