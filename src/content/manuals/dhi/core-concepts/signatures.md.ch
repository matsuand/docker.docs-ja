@x
Code signing is the process of applying a cryptographic signature to software
artifacts, such as Docker images, to verify their integrity and authenticity. By
signing an image, you ensure that it has not been altered since it was signed
and that it originates from a trusted source.

@x
In the context of Docker Hardened Images (DHIs), code signing is achieved using
[Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/), a tool developed by the Sigstore project.
Cosign enables secure and verifiable signing of container images, enhancing
trust and security in the software supply chain.

- Authenticity: Verifies that the image was created by a trusted source.
- Integrity: Ensures that the image has not been tampered with since it was
  signed.
- Compliance: Helps meet regulatory and organizational security requirements.

Docker Hardened Images are signed by Docker to prove their origin and integrity,
but if you're building application images that extend or use DHIs as a base, you
should sign your own images as well.

images frequently, or in any scenario where image provenance must be auditable.

This command will prompt you to authenticate via an OIDC provider (such as
GitHub, Google, or Microsoft). Upon successful authentication, Cosign will
generate a short-lived certificate and sign the image. The signature will be
stored in a transparency log and associated with the image in the registry.
