Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) is a security framework
designed to enhance the integrity and security of software supply chains.
Developed by Google and maintained by the Open Source Security Foundation
(OpenSSF), SLSA provides a set of guidelines and best practices to prevent
tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure in software
projects.

SLSA defines [four build levels (0–3)](https://slsa.dev/spec/latest/levels) of
increasing security rigor, focusing on areas such as build provenance, source
integrity, and build environment security. Each level builds upon the previous
one, offering a structured approach to achieving higher levels of software
supply chain security.

Docker Hardened Images (DHIs) are secure-by-default container images
purpose-built for modern production environments. Each DHI is cryptographically
signed and complies with the [SLSA Build Level 3
standard](https://slsa.dev/spec/latest/levels#build-l3-hardened-builds), ensuring
verifiable build provenance and integrity.
