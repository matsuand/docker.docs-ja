An SBOM is a detailed inventory that lists all components, libraries, and
dependencies used in building a software application. It provides transparency
into the software supply chain by documenting each component's version, origin,
and relationship to other components. Think of it as a "recipe" for your
software, detailing every ingredient and how they come together.

@x
In today's software landscape, applications often comprise numerous components
from various sources, including open-source libraries, third-party services, and
proprietary code. This complexity can obscure visibility into potential
vulnerabilities and complicate compliance efforts. SBOMs address these
challenges by providing a detailed inventory of all components within an
application.

## Docker Hardened Image SBOMs

@x
Docker Hardened Images come with built-in SBOMs, ensuring that every component
in the image is documented and verifiable. These SBOMs are cryptographically
signed, providing a tamper-evident record of the image's contents. This
integration simplifies audits and enhances trust in the software supply chain.

Since Docker Hardened Images come with signed SBOMs, you can use Docker Scout to
verify the authenticity and integrity of the SBOM attached to the image. This
ensures that the SBOM has not been tampered with and that the image's contents
are trustworthy.
