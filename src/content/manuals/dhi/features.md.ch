Docker Hardened Images (DHI) are minimal, secure, and production-ready container
base and application images maintained by Docker. Designed to reduce
vulnerabilities and simplify compliance, DHI integrates easily into your
existing Docker-based workflows with little to no retooling required.

- Near-zero CVEs: Continuously scanned and patched to maintain minimal known
  exploitable vulnerabilities, with no SLA-backed time commitments for non-DHI
  Enterprise users
- Minimal attack surface: Distroless variants reduce attack surface by up to 95% by removing unnecessary components
- Non-root execution: Run as non-root by default, following the principle of least privilege
- Transparent vulnerability reporting: Every CVE is visible and assessed using public dataâ€”no suppressed feeds or proprietary scoring

Docker Hardened Image (DHI) charts are Docker-provided Helm charts built from
upstream sources, designed for compatibility with Docker Hardened Images. These
charts are available as OCI artifacts within the DHI catalog on Docker Hub. DHI
charts are robustly tested after building to ensure they work out-of-the-box
with Docker Hardened Images. This removes friction in migration and reduces
developer workload in implementing the charts, ensuring seamless compatibility.

- SLSA Level 3 compliance: Each chart is built with Docker's SLSA Build Level 3
  system, including a detailed build provenance, and meeting the standards set
  by the Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) framework.
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs): Comprehensive SBOMs are provided,
  detailing all components referenced within the chart to facilitate
  vulnerability management and compliance audits.
- Cryptographic signing: All associated metadata is cryptographically signed by
  Docker, ensuring integrity and authenticity.
- Hardened configuration: Charts automatically reference Docker hardened images,
  ensuring security in deployments.
