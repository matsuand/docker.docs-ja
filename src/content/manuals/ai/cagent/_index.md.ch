cagent relies on the concept of a _root agent_ that acts as a team lead and
delegates tasks to the sub-agents you define.
Each agent:
- uses the model of your choice, with the parameters of your choice.
- has access to the [built-in tools](#built-in-tools) and MCP servers
  configured in the [Docker MCP gateway](/manuals/ai/mcp-gateway/_index.md).
- works in its own context. They do not share knowledge.
