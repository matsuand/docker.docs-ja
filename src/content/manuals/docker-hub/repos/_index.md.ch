A Docker Hub repository is a collection of container images, enabling you to
store, manage, and share Docker images publicly or privately. Each repository
serves as a dedicated space where you can store images associated with a
particular application, microservice, or project. Content in repositories is
organized by tags, which represent different versions of the same application,
allowing users to pull the right version when needed.
