Strengthen the security of your Docker images with Docker Hub's image security
insights. Docker Hub lets you perform either point-in-time static vulnerability
scanning or always up-to-date image analysis using Docker Scout.

The scan results shows the security state of your images at the time when the

### Changes to static scanning in Docker Hub

### Changes to static scanning in Docker Hub

@x
From February 27th, 2023, Docker changed the technology that supports the
Docker Hub static scanning feature. The static scanning is now powered natively
by Docker, instead of a third-party.

@z

@x
As a result of this change, scanning now detects vulnerabilities at a more
granular level than before. This in turn means that vulnerability reports may
show a higher number of vulnerabilities. If you used vulnerability scanning
before February 27th, 2023, you may see that new vulnerability reports list a
higher number of vulnerabilities, due to a more thorough analysis.

with no interruption or changes to pricing. Historical data continues to be
available.
