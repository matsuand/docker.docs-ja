- High availability and uptime: Docker's systems are designed for failover
  across multiple availability zones, with load-balanced autoscaling, enabling
  99.9% uptime.
- Global delivery and fast downloads: Docker leverages Cloudflare's CDN and
  caching (with Cache Reserve) to achieve cache hit ratios more than 99%,
  reducing reliance on origin traffic and ensuring fast access for developers
  everywhere.
- Durability: Docker maintains a documented backup policy and performs full
  daily backups of production data.

Verified publisher images are exempt from standard [Docker Hub rate
limits](../../../usage/_index.md), ensuring developers can pull your images
without restrictions. **This applies to all users, including unauthenticated users**,
who get unlimited pulls for DVP images. This eliminates potential barriers to adoption and
provides a seamless experience for users of your content.

DVP partners can verify this unlimited access by checking the absence of rate
limiting headers when pulling their images. When pulling DVP images, users won't
see `ratelimit-limit` or `ratelimit-remaining` headers, indicating unlimited
access. For more details on checking rate limits, see [View pull rate and
limit](../../../usage/pulls.md#view-pull-rate-and-limit).
