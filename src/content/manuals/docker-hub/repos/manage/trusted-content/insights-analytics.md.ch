Insights and analytics provides usage analytics for [Docker Verified Publisher
(DVP)](https://www.docker.com/partners/programs/) and [Docker-Sponsored Open
Source (DSOS)](https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/application/#)
images on Docker Hub. This includes self-serve access to image and extension
usage metrics for a desired time span. You can see the number of image pulls by
tag or by digest, geolocation, cloud provider, client, and more.

The image pulls raw dataset includes user IP domains as a data point. This is
the domain name associated with the IP address used to pull an image. If the IP
type is `business`, the domain represents the company or organization associated
with that IP address (for example, `docker.com`). For any other IP type that's
not `business`, the domain represents the internet service provider or hosting
provider used to make the request. On average, only about 30% of all pulls
classify as the `business` IP type (this varies between publishers and images).
