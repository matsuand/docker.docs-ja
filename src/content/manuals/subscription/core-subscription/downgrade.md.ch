### SSO and SCIM

@x
If you want to downgrade a Docker Business subscription and your organization uses single sign-on (SSO) for user authentication, you need to remove your SSO connection and verified domains before downgrading. After removing the SSO connection, any organization members that were auto-provisioned (for example, with SCIM) need to set up a password to sign in without SSO. To do this, users can [reset their password at sign in](/accounts/create-account/#reset-your-password-at-sign-in).
