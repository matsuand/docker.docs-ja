- Team size and repositories: You may need to reduce team members and convert private repositories to public or delete them based on your new subscription limits.
- SSO and SCIM: If downgrading from Docker Business and your organization uses single sign-on, remove your SSO connection and verified domains first. Organization members who were auto-provisioned through SCIM need to reset their passwords to sign in without SSO.
- Private repository collaborators: Personal subscriptions don't include collaborators for private repositories. When downgrading from Pro to Personal, all collaborators are removed and additional private repositories are locked.
