Docker subscriptions let you scale your consumption as your needs evolve. Except
for legacy Docker subscription plans, all paid Docker subscriptions come with
access to Docker Hub, Docker Build Cloud, and Testcontainers Cloud with a base
amount of consumption. See [Docker subscriptions and features](./details.md) to
learn how much base consumption comes with each subscription. You can scale your
consumption at any time during your subscription period.

You can pre-purchase Testcontainers Cloud runtime minutes by [contacting
 sales](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/). In addition to
pre-purchase, you are able to use as many minutes as you need on-demand. The
usage will be billed at the end of each monthly billing cycle. On-demand usage
is billed at a higher rate than pre-purchased capacity. To avoid on-demand
charges, pre-purchase additional minutes.
