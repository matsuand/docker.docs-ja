Docker Compose supports provider services, which allow integration with services whose lifecycles are managed by third-party components rather than by Compose itself.  
This feature enables you to define and utilize platform-specific services without the need for manual setup or direct lifecycle management.

Provider services are a special type of service in Compose that represents platform capabilities rather than containers.
They allow you to declare dependencies on specific platform features that your application needs.

When you define a provider service in your Compose file, Compose works with the platform to provision and configure
the requested capability, making it available to your application services.

```yaml
services:
  database:
    provider:
      type: awesomecloud
      options:

    depends_on:
       - database
```
@z

@x
Notice the dedicated `provider` attribute in the `database` service.
This attribute specifies that the service is managed by a provider and lets you define options specific to that provider type.
@y

This attribute specifies that the service is managed by a provider and lets you define options specific to that provider type.
@z

@x
The `depends_on` attribute in the `app` service specifies that it depends on the `database` service.
This means that the `database` service will be started before the `app` service, allowing the provider information
to be injected into the `app` service.
@y
The `depends_on` attribute in the `app` service specifies that it depends on the `database` service.
This means that the `database` service will be started before the `app` service, allowing the provider information

## How it works

## How it works
@z

@x
During the `docker compose up` command execution, Compose identifies services relying on providers and works with them to provision
the requested capabilities. The provider then populates Compose model with information about how to access the provisioned resource.

This information is passed to services that declare a dependency on the provider service, typically through environment
variables. The naming convention for these variables is:

```env

```env

For example, if your provider service is named `database`, your application service might receive environment variables like:
@y
For example, if your provider service is named `database`, your application service might receive environment variables like:
@z

@x
- `DATABASE_URL` with the URL to access the provisioned resource
- `DATABASE_TOKEN` with an authentication token
- Other provider-specific variables
@y
- `DATABASE_URL` with the URL to access the provisioned resource
- `DATABASE_TOKEN` with an authentication token
- Other provider-specific variables

Your application can then use these environment variables to interact with the provisioned resource.

For detailed information on how to create and implement your own provider, refer to the [Compose Extensions documentation](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/main/docs/extension.md).   
This guide explains the extension mechanism that allows you to add new provider types to Compose.
