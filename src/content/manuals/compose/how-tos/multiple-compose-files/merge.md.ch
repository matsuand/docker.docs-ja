By default, Compose reads two files, a `compose.yaml` and an optional
`compose.override.yaml` file. By convention, the `compose.yaml`
contains your base configuration. The override file can
contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new
services.

@x
To use multiple override files, or an override file with a different name, you
can either use the pre-defined [COMPOSE_FILE](../environment-variables/envvars.md#compose_file) environment variable, or use the `-f` option to specify the list of files.

the order they're specified on the command line. Subsequent files may merge, override, or

- Paths are evaluated relative to the base file. When you use multiple Compose files, you must make sure all paths in the files are relative to the base Compose file (the first Compose file specified
with `-f`). This is required because override files need not be valid
Compose files. Override files can contain small fragments of configuration.
Tracking which fragment of a service is relative to which path is difficult and
confusing, so to keep paths easier to understand, all paths must be defined
relative to the base file.

If a configuration option is defined in both the original service and the local
service, the local value replaces or extends the original value.

- Using `-f` is optional. If not provided, Compose searches the working directory and its parent directories for a `compose.yaml` and a `compose.override.yaml` file. You must supply at least the `compose.yaml` file. If both files exist on the same directory level, Compose combines them into a single configuration.

- You can use the `-f` flag to specify a path to a Compose file that is not located in the current directory, either from the command line or by setting up a [COMPOSE_FILE environment variable](../environment-variables/envvars.md#compose_file) in your shell or in an environment file.

   For example, if you are running the [Compose Rails sample](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/official-documentation-samples/rails/README.md), and have a `compose.yaml` file in a directory called `sandbox/rails`. You can use a command like [docker compose pull](/reference/cli/docker/compose/pull.md) to get the postgres image for the `db` service from anywhere by using the `-f` flag as follows: `docker compose -f ~/sandbox/rails/compose.yaml pull db`

A common use case for multiple files is changing a development Compose app
for a production-like environment (which may be production, staging or CI).
To support these differences, you can split your Compose configuration into
a few different files:

@x
Docker Compose supports relative paths for the many resources to be included in the application model: build context for service images, location of file defining environment variables, path to a local directory used in a bind-mounted volume.
With such a constraint, code organization in a monorepo can become hard as a natural choice would be to have dedicated folders per team or component, but then the Compose files relative paths become irrelevant.
