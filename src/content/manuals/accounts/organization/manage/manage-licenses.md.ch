A member can use the product if they have a license from their team, from an
individual assignment, or from automatic assignment. Each member uses one
license per product. Assigning the same product again through another team or
as an individual assignment does not consume a second license.

Automatic license assignment gives members a product license when they use a
supported product. Use the **Automatic license assignment** toggle on the
product's license card on the **Licenses** page. The toggle appears only when
that product supports automatic assignment, so you may not see it on every
card.

- Docker Core: members receive a license when they sign in to Docker Desktop.
- AI Governance: members receive a license when they sign in to
  [Docker Sandboxes](/manuals/ai/sandboxes/_index.md). The `sbx login` command
  provisions licenses on a first-come, first-served basis.
- Licenses are assigned until exhausted.
  - Once the available licenses are exhausted, automatic license assignment
    stops until more licenses are available.
  - Members can still use Docker Sandboxes or Docker Desktop, but
    organization policies for those products won't affect their usage.

AI Governance licenses include single sign-on (SSO) and provisioning features
regardless of your Docker Core subscription. With automatic assignment on,
Docker assigns a license when a member uses Docker Sandboxes, whether they
joined by invitation or through SSO with System for Cross-domain Identity
Management (SCIM) or Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning.

Removing a license from a team, or
[deleting a team](/manuals/accounts/organization/manage/manage-a-team.md#delete-a-team),
removes that license from every member of the team, unless they hold it from a
direct assignment or through membership in another team. The license returns to
the available pool. The same applies when a member leaves a team. Revoking a
license from one member returns that license to the available pool.
