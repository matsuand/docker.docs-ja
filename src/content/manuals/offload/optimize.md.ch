Docker Offload runs your builds remotely, not on the machine where you invoke the
build. This means that files must be transferred from your local system to the
cloud over the network.

Transferring files over the network introduces higher latency and lower
bandwidth compared to local transfers. To reduce these effects, Docker Offload
includes several performance optimizations:

- It uses attached storage volumes for build cache, which makes reading and writing cache fast.
- When pulling build results back to your local machine, it only transfers layers that changed since the previous build.

Even with these optimizations, large projects or slower network connections can
lead to longer transfer times. Here are several ways to optimize your build
setup for Docker Offload:

@x
A [`.dockerignore` file](/manuals/build/concepts/context.md#dockerignore-files)
lets you specify which local files should *not* be included in the build
context. Files excluded by these patterns won’t be uploaded to Docker Offload
during a build.

- `.git` – avoids transferring your version history. (Note: you won’t be able to run `git` commands in the build.)
- Build artifacts or locally generated binaries.

  process.

@x
Smaller base images in your `FROM` instructions can reduce final image size and
improve build performance. The [`alpine`](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) image
is a good example of a minimal base.

For fully static binaries, you can use [`scratch`](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch), which is an empty base image.

## Multi-stage builds

@x
[Multi-stage builds](/build/building/multi-stage/) let you separate build-time
and runtime environments in your Dockerfile. This not only reduces the size of
the final image but also allows for parallel stage execution during the build.

Use `COPY --from` to copy files from earlier stages or external images. This
approach helps minimize unnecessary layers and reduce final image size.

When possible, download large files from the internet during the build itself
instead of bundling them in your local context. This avoids network transfer
from your client to Docker Offload.

Some build tools, such as `make`, are single-threaded by default. If the tool
supports it, configure it to run in parallel. For example, use `make --jobs=4`
to run four jobs simultaneously.
