Image Access Management lets administrators control which types of images developers can pull from Docker Hub. This prevents developers from accidentally using untrusted community images that could pose security risks to your organization.

Image Access Management helps prevent supply chain attacks by ensuring developers only use trusted container images. For example, a developer building a new application might accidentally use a malicious community image as a component. Image Access Management prevents this by restricting access to only approved image types.

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com) and select your organization from the top-left account drop-down.
1. Select **Admin Console**, then **Image access**.
1. Use the **toggle** to enable image access.
1. Select which image types to allow:
    - **Organization images**: Images from your organization (always allowed by default). These can be public or private images created by members within your organization.
    - **Community images**: Images contributed by various users that may pose security risks. This category includes Docker-Sponsored Open Source images and is turned off by default.
    - **Docker Verified Publisher Images**: Images from Docker partners in the Verified Publisher program, qualified for secure supply chains.
    - **Docker Official Images**: Curated Docker repositories that provide OS repositories, best practices for Dockerfiles, drop-in solutions, and timely security updates.

- Monitor usage patterns: Review which images developers are attempting to pull, identify legitimate requests for additional image types, regularly audit approved image categories for continued relevance, and use Docker Desktop analytics to monitor usage patterns.
- Layer security controls: Image Access Management works best with Registry Access Management to control which registries developers can access, Enhanced Container Isolation to secure containers at runtime, and Settings Management to control Docker Desktop configuration.

## Scope and bypass considerations

@x
- Image Access Management only controls access to Docker Hub images. Images from other registries aren't affected by these policies. Use [Registry Access Management](/manuals/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/registry-access-management.md) to control access to other registries.
- Users can potentially bypass Image Access Management by signing out of Docker Desktop (unless sign-in is enforced), using images from other registries that aren't restricted, or using registry mirrors or proxies. Enforce sign-in and combine with Registry Access Management for comprehensive control.
- Image restrictions apply to Dockerfile `FROM` instructions, Docker Compose services using restricted images will fail, multi-stage builds may be affected if intermediate images are restricted, and CI/CD pipelines using diverse image types may be impacted.
