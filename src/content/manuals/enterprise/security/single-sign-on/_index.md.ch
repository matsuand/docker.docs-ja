Single sign-on (SSO) lets users access Docker by authenticating through their
identity providers (IdPs). SSO can be configured for an entire company,
including all associated organizations, or for a single organization that has a
Docker Business subscription.

When SSO is enabled, Docker supports a non-IdP-initiated flow for user sign-in.
Instead of signing in with a Docker username and password, users are redirected
to your IdP’s sign-in page. Users must initiate the SSO authentication process
by signing in to Docker Hub or Docker Desktop.

1. Link Docker to your identity provider.
1. Test your SSO connection.
1. Provision users in Docker.

Once configuration is complete, users can sign in to Docker services using
their company email address. After signing in, users are added to your company,
assigned to an organization, and added to a team.

- Notify your company about the upcoming SSO sign-in process.
- Ensure all users have Docker Desktop version 4.42 or later installed.
- Confirm that each Docker user has a valid IdP account using the same
email address as their Unique Primary Identifier (UPN).
- If you plan to [enforce SSO](/manuals/enterprise/security/single-sign-on/connect.md#optional-enforce-sso),
users accessing Docker through the CLI must [create a personal access token (PAT)](/docker-hub/access-tokens/). The PAT replaces their username and password for authentication.
- Ensure CI/CD pipelines use PATs or OATs instead of passwords.

Using a PAT ensures continued CLI access. For more information, see the
[security announcement](/manuals/security/security-announcements.md#deprecation-of-password-logins-on-cli-when-sso-enforced).
