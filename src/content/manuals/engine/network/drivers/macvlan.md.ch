Some applications, especially legacy applications or applications which monitor
network traffic, expect to be directly connected to the physical network. In
this type of situation, you can use the `macvlan` network driver to assign a MAC
address to each container's virtual network interface, making it appear to be
a physical network interface directly connected to the physical network. In this
case, you need to designate a physical interface on your Docker host to use for
the Macvlan, as well as the subnet and gateway of the network. You can even
isolate your Macvlan networks using different physical network interfaces.

To create a `macvlan` network which bridges with a given physical network
interface, use `--driver macvlan` with the `docker network create` command. You
also need to specify the `parent`, which is the interface the traffic will
physically go through on the Docker host.

automatically.
