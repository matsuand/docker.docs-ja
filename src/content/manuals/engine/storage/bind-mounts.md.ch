When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted
from the host into a container. By contrast, when you use a volume, a new
directory is created within Docker's storage directory on the host machine, and
Docker manages that directory's contents.

If you bind mount file or directory into a directory in the container in which
files or directories exist, the pre-existing files are obscured by the mount.
This is similar to if you were to save files into `/mnt` on a Linux host, and
then mounted a USB drive into `/mnt`. The contents of `/mnt` would be obscured
by the contents of the USB drive until the USB drive was unmounted.

With containers, there's no straightforward way of removing a mount to reveal
the obscured files again. Your best option is to recreate the container without
the mount.

  One side effect of using bind mounts is that you can change the host
  filesystem via processes running in a container, including creating,
  modifying, or deleting important system files or directories. This capability
  can have security implications. For example, it may affect non-Docker
  processes on the host system.

Consider a case where you have a directory `source` and that when you build the
source code, the artifacts are saved into another directory, `source/target/`.
You want the artifacts to be available to the container at `/app/`, and you
want the container to get access to a new build each time you build the source
on your development host. Use the following command to bind-mount the `target/`
directory into your container at `/app/`. Run the command from within the
`source` directory. The `$(pwd)` sub-command expands to the current working
directory on Linux or macOS hosts.

When you bind mount a path that itself contains mounts, those submounts are
also included in the bind mount by default. This behavior is configurable,
using the `bind-recursive` option for `--mount`. This option is only supported
with the `--mount` flag, not with `-v` or `--volume`.

If the bind mount is read-only, the Docker Engine makes a best-effort attempt
at making the submounts read-only as well. This is referred to as recursive
read-only mounts. Recursive read-only mounts require Linux kernel version 5.12
or later. If you're running an older kernel version, submounts are
automatically mounted as read-write by default. Attempting to set submounts to
be read-only on a kernel version earlier than 5.12, using the
`bind-recursive=readonly` option, results in an error.

Bind propagation defaults to `rprivate` for both bind mounts and volumes. It is
only configurable for bind mounts, and only on Linux host machines. Bind
propagation is an advanced topic and many users never need to configure it.

Bind propagation refers to whether or not mounts created within a given
bind-mount can be propagated to replicas of that mount. Consider
a mount point `/mnt`, which is also mounted on `/tmp`. The propagation settings
control whether a mount on `/tmp/a` would also be available on `/mnt/a`. Each
propagation setting has a recursive counterpoint. In the case of recursion,
consider that `/tmp/a` is also mounted as `/foo`. The propagation settings
control whether `/mnt/a` and/or `/tmp/a` would exist.
