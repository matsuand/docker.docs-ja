It was created by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) and is open sourced
under the CDDL license. Due to licensing incompatibilities between the CDDL and
GPL, ZFS cannot be shipped as part of the mainline Linux kernel. However, the
ZFS On Linux (ZoL) project provides an out-of-tree kernel module and userspace
tools which can be installed separately.

- ZFS requires one or more dedicated block devices, preferably solid-state
  drives (SSDs).
- The `/var/lib/docker/` directory must be mounted on a ZFS-formatted
  filesystem.
- Changing the storage driver makes any containers you have already
  created inaccessible on the local system. Use `docker save` to save containers,
  and push existing images to Docker Hub or a private repository, so that you
  do not need to re-create them later.

- **Fragmentation**: Fragmentation is a natural byproduct of copy-on-write
  filesystems like ZFS. ZFS mitigates this by using a small block size of 128k.
  The ZFS intent log (ZIL) and the coalescing of writes (delayed writes) also
  help to reduce fragmentation. You can monitor fragmentation using
  `zpool status`. However, there is no way to defragment ZFS without reformatting
  and restoring the filesystem.
