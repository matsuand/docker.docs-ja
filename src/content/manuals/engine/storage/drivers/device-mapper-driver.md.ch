Device Mapper is a kernel-based framework that underpins many advanced
volume management technologies on Linux. Docker's `devicemapper` storage driver
leverages the thin provisioning and snapshotting capabilities of this framework
for image and container management. This article refers to the Device Mapper
storage driver as `devicemapper`, and the kernel framework as _Device Mapper_.

For the systems where it is supported, `devicemapper` support is included in
the Linux kernel. However, specific configuration is required to use it with
Docker.

The `devicemapper` driver uses block devices dedicated to Docker and operates at
the block level, rather than the file level. These devices can be extended by
adding physical storage to your Docker host, and they perform better than using
a filesystem at the operating system (OS) level.

- `devicemapper` is supported on Docker Engine - Community running on CentOS, Fedora,
  SLES 15, Ubuntu, Debian, or RHEL.
- `devicemapper` requires the `lvm2` and `device-mapper-persistent-data` packages
  to be installed.
- Changing the storage driver makes any containers you have already
  created inaccessible on the local system. Use `docker save` to save containers,
  and push existing images to Docker Hub or a private repository, so you do
  not need to recreate them later.

@x
This configuration is only appropriate for testing. The `loop-lvm` mode makes
use of a 'loopback' mechanism that allows files on the local disk to be
read from and written to as if they were an actual physical disk or block
device.
However, the addition of the loopback mechanism, and interaction with the OS
filesystem layer, means that IO operations can be slow and resource-intensive.
Use of loopback devices can also introduce race conditions.
However, setting up `loop-lvm` mode can help identify basic issues (such as
missing user space packages, kernel drivers, etc.) ahead of attempting the more
complex set up required to enable `direct-lvm` mode. `loop-lvm` mode should
therefore only be used to perform rudimentary testing prior to configuring
`direct-lvm`.

Production hosts using the `devicemapper` storage driver must use `direct-lvm`
mode. This mode uses block devices to create the thin pool. This is faster than
using loopback devices, uses system resources more efficiently, and block
devices can grow as needed. However, more setup is required than in `loop-lvm`
mode.

- **Note**: when using `devicemapper` and the `json-file` log driver, the log
  files generated by a container are still stored in Docker's dataroot directory, 
  by default `/var/lib/docker`.  If your containers generate lots of log messages, 
  this may lead to increased disk usage or the inability to manage your system due
  to a full disk. You can configure a 
  [log driver](/manuals/engine/logging/configure.md) to store your container
  logs externally.
