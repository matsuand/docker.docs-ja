This fetches the Bake definition from the specified remote location and
executes the groups or targets defined in that file. If the remote Bake
definition doesn't specify a build context, the context is automatically set to
the Git remote. For example, [this case](https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/2776a6d694f988c0c1df61cad4bfac0f54e481c8/docker-bake.hcl#L17-L26)

@x
When building with a remote Bake definition, you may want to consume local
files relative to the directory where the Bake command is executed. You can
define contexts as relative to the command context using a `cwd://` prefix.

@x
You can append a path to the `cwd://` prefix if you want to use a specific
local directory as a context. Note that if you do specify a path, it must be
within the working directory where the command gets executed. If you use an
absolute path, or a relative path leading outside of the working directory,
Bake will throw an error.

You can also use the `cwd://` prefix to define local directories in the Bake

The following example defines the `docs` context as `./src/docs/content`,

By contrast, if you omit the `cwd://` prefix, the path would be resolved

One case where combining local and remote Bake definitions becomes necessary is
when you're building with a remote Bake definition in GitHub Actions and want
to use the [metadata-action](https://github.com/docker/metadata-action) to
generate tags, annotations, or labels. The metadata action generates a Bake
file available in the runner's local Bake execution context. To use both the
remote definition and the local "metadata-only" Bake file, specify both files
and use the `cwd://` prefix for the metadata Bake file:

If you can authenticate to the private repository using the default `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`,
then you don't need to specify any additional authentication parameters for Bake.
Bake automatically uses your default agent socket.
