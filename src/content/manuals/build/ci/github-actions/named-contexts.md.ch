@x
You can define [additional build contexts](/reference/cli/docker/buildx/build.md#build-context),
and access them in your Dockerfile with `FROM name` or `--from=name`. When
Dockerfile defines a stage with the same name it's overwritten.

This can be useful with GitHub Actions to reuse results from other builds or pin
an image to a specific tag in your workflow.

By default, the [Docker Setup Buildx](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-setup-buildx)
action uses `docker-container` as a build driver, so built Docker images aren't
loaded automatically.

As shown in the previous section we are not using the default
[`docker-container` driver](../../builders/drivers/docker-container.md) for building with
named contexts. That's because this driver can't load an image from the Docker
store as it's isolated. To solve this problem you can use a [local registry](local-registry.md)
to push your base image in your workflow:
