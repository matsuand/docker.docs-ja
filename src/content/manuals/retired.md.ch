@x
Docker Machine was a tool for provisioning and managing Docker hosts across
various platforms, including virtual machines and cloud providers. It is no
longer maintained, and users are encouraged to use [Docker Desktop](/manuals/desktop/_index.md)
or [Docker Engine](/manuals/engine/_index.md) directly on supported platforms.
Machine's approach to creating and configuring hosts has been superseded by
more modern workflows that integrate more closely with Docker Desktop.

@x
Docker Toolbox was used on older systems where Docker Desktop could not run. It
bundled Docker Machine, Docker Engine, and Docker Compose into a single
installer. Toolbox is no longer maintained and is effectively replaced by
[Docker Desktop](/manuals/desktop/_index.md) on current systems. References to
Docker Toolbox occasionally appear in older documentation or community
tutorials, but it is not recommended for new installations.

### Docker Cloud integrations
@z

@x
Docker previously offered integrations for Amazon's Elastic Container Service
(ECS) and Azure Container Instances (ACI) to streamline container workflows.
These integrations have been deprecated, and users should now rely on native
cloud tools or third-party solutions to manage their workloads. The move toward
platform-specific or universal orchestration tools reduced the need for
specialized Docker Cloud integrations.

Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) was Docker's commercial platform for deploying
and managing large-scale container environments. It was acquired by Mirantis in
2019, and users looking for enterprise-level functionality can now explore
Mirantis Kubernetes Engine or other products offered by Mirantis. Much of the
technology and features found in Docker EE have been absorbed into the Mirantis
product line.

@x
Docker Data Center (DDC) was an umbrella term that encompassed Docker Universal
Control Plane (UCP) and Docker Trusted Registry (DTR). These components
provided a full-stack solution for managing containers, security, and registry
services in enterprise environments. They are now under the Mirantis portfolio
following the Docker Enterprise acquisition. Users still encountering
references to DDC, UCP, or DTR should refer to Mirantis's documentation for
guidance on modern equivalents.

Dev Environments was a feature introduced in Docker Desktop that allowed
developers to spin up development environments quickly. This feature is no
longer under active development. Similar workflows can be achieved through
Docker Compose or by creating custom configurations tailored to specific
project requirements.

The Docker Registry served as the open-source implementation of a container

in 2019 and is maintained under the name "Distribution." It remains a

favor of Kubernetes-based solutions. Individuals evaluating container
orchestration options should investigate whether SwarmKit meets modern workload
requirements.
