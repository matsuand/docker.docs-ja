@x
Docker recommends running Docker Desktop natively on Mac, Linux, or Windows. However, Docker Desktop for Windows can run inside a virtual desktop provided the virtual desktop is properly configured.
@y
Docker Desktop では、Mac、Linux、Windows のいずれかにおいてネイティブに実行することをお勧めします。
ただし仮想デスクトップが適切に設定できていれば、Docker Desktop for Windows を仮想デスクトップ内で実行することも可能です。

@x
To run Docker Desktop in a virtual desktop environment, you have two options,
depending on whether nested virtualization is supported:
@y
仮想デスクトップ環境内において Docker Desktop を実行するには、2 つの方法があります。
それはネスト化された仮想化環境がサポートされているかどうかで決まります。

@x
- If your environment supports nested virtualization, you can run Docker Desktop
  with its default local Linux VM.
- If nested virtualization is not supported, Docker recommends using [Docker
  Offload](/offload/).

Docker Offload lets you offload container workloads to a high-performance, fully

@x
Docker Offload is useful in virtual desktop environments where nested
virtualization isn't supported. In these environments, Docker Desktop defaults
to using Docker Offload to ensure you can still build and run containers without
relying on local virtualization.

@x
Docker Offload decouples the Docker Desktop client from the Docker Engine,
allowing the Docker CLI and Docker Desktop Dashboard to interact with
cloud-based resources as if they were local. When you run a container, Docker
provisions a secure, isolated, and ephemeral cloud environment connected to
Docker Desktop via an SSH tunnel. Despite running remotely, features like bind
mounts and port forwarding continue to work seamlessly, providing a local-like
experience. To use Docker Offload:

Docker support includes installing and running Docker Desktop within the VM, provided that nested virtualization is correctly enabled. The only hypervisors successfully tested are VMware ESXi and Azure, and there is no support for other VMs. For more information on Docker Desktop support, see [Get support](/manuals/desktop/troubleshoot-and-support/support.md).

For troubleshooting problems and intermittent failures that are outside of Docker's control, you should contact your hypervisor vendor. Each hypervisor vendor offers different levels of support. For example, Microsoft supports running nested Hyper-V both on-prem and on Azure, with some version constraints. This may not be the case for VMware ESXi.

Nested virtualization of other hypervisors like Hyper-V inside a vSphere VM [is not a supported scenario](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2009916). However, running Hyper-V VM in a VMware ESXi VM is technically possible and, depending on the version, ESXi includes hardware-assisted virtualization as a supported feature. A VM that had 1 CPU with 4 cores and 12GB of memory was used for internal testing.

For Azure virtual machines, [check that the VM size chosen supports nested virtualization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes). Microsoft provides [a helpful list on Azure VM sizes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/acu) and highlights the sizes that currently support nested virtualization. D4s_v5 machines were used for internal testing. Use this specification or above for optimal performance of Docker Desktop.

Docker Desktop can be used within Nutanix-powered VDI environments provided that the underlying Windows environment supports WSL 2 or Windows container mode. Since Nutanix officially supports WSL 2, Docker Desktop should function as expected, as long as WSL 2 operates correctly within the VDI environment.
