This issue occurs due to a non-atomic copy during a drag/drop installation. When you drag and drop `Docker.app` from a DMG file while another application, like VS Code, is invoking the Docker CLI through symlinks, the copy operation may be interrupted, leaving the app in a partially copied state that Gatekeeper marks as "damaged".
