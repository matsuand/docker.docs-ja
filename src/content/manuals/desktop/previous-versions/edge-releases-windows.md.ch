- Fixed an issue with http proxy exclude lists containing entries such as `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. Fixes [docker/for-win#8750](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/8750).
- When WSL integration process unexpectedly stops, the user is now notified and can decide to restart it or not, instead of always try to restart it in a loop. fixes [docker/for-win#8968](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/8968).
- Fixed an issue related to container logs that lag under heavy load. Fixes [docker/for-win#8216](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/8216).
- Diagnostics: avoid hanging when Kubernetes is in a broken state.
- When sharing a file into a container (e.g. `docker run -v ~/.gitconfig`) Docker Desktop does not watch the parent directory. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4981](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4981).
- Always flush file system caches synchronously on container start. See [docker/for-mac#4943](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4943).

- Fixed application startup if `hosts` is specified inside the Docker `daemon.json`. See [docker/for-win#6895](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6895#issuecomment-637429117).
- Fixed opening a CLI from the dashboard for Windows containers. See [docker/for-win#7079](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/7079).
- Fixed an issue where adding a folder on a non-existing drive in the settings would create an empty entry. See [docker/for-win#6797](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6797).
- Fixed an issue when updating Windows to a WSL 2 capable version, where a configuration file is locked by the old Hyper-V VM.
- Pinning the application to the taskbar and clicking on it will launch the container view if Docker is already running.
- Left-clicking on the Docker icon in the system tray now launches the container view Dashboard. See [docker/for-win#6650](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6650).
- Fixed an issue which blocks Docker Desktop startup if `localhost:2375` is used by another program. See [docker/for-win#6929](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6929) and [docker/for-win#6961](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6961).
- Docker contexts are now synced between Windows and WSL 2 distributions.
- Docker Desktop now prompts users to share drives for paths like `////c/Users/foo`, rather than only paths like `C:\Users\foo` and `C:/Users/foo`.
- The installer now returns a non-zero exit code on error or when the user cancels the installation.
- Avoid failing withFixed an issue which caused Docker Desktop to fail with `Function not implemented` error during file I/O on shared volumes. See [docker/for-win#5955](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5955).
- Fixed an issue when bind mounting a mounted host directory inside a container. See [docker/for-win#5089](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5089).
- Removed the legacy Kubernetes context `docker-for-desktop`. The context `docker-desktop` should be used instead. See [docker/for-win#5089](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5089).

**File sharing**
- Kubernetes: Persistent volumes created by claims are now stored in the virtual machine. Fixes [for-win/issues/5665](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5665).
- Docker Desktop ensures that host paths accessed by containers are within the shared folders list.
- Fixed a bug where opening a read-only file would fail with an `Operation not permitted error`. Fixes [docker/for-win#6016](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6016) and [docker/for-win#6017](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6017).
- Fixed path handling for `docker volume create -o type=none -o o=bind -o device=C:\Some\Windows\path`.
- Fixed a bug which prevented open files from being deleted. Fixes [docker/for-win#5565](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5565).
- Docker Desktop now avoids locking files on the host which are open in containers.
- Docker Desktop generates `fsnotify.WRITE` events in Linux containers when files are changed on the host. [docker/for-win#5530](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5530#issuecomment-585572414)
- Docker Desktop now displays hidden files on shared volumes. Fixes [docker/for-win#5808](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5808).
- Fixed cache invalidation and event injection for shared volumes with long paths.

  However, if your current setup relies on IP addresses for communication, you can use a temporary workaround to reinstate DockerNAT. To do this, open
`C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\MobyLinux.ps1` and add `$SwitchName = "DockerNAT"` between line 175 and 176. Note that the temporary workaround to reinstate DockerNAT may be removed from future releases.
- Directory junctions in shared volumes pointing outside the shared volume do not work.
- It is currently not possible to rename open files within shared volumes.
- In some cases, Docker containers do not synchronize time with the host when the host machine is put to sleep.
- It is not possible to use `localhost` in the proxy settings. You can instead use `host.docker.internal` to work around this issue.

- The Dashboard stops updating when you switch the container mode between Linux and Windows. To work around this issue, close and reopen the Dashboard.
- The new gRPC FUSE file sharing implementation does not support connecting to new drives after Docker Desktop starts (for example, a USB drive). If you would like to share the new drive in Docker Desktop, you must quit Docker Desktop and then start the application to refresh the list of drives in Settings.

- Docker Desktop now automatically restarts after an update.
- Fixed an issue where Docker Desktop auto-start was not being disabled properly on some machines.
- Fixed a container start error when a container has more than one port with an arbitrary or not-yet-configured external port number. For example, `docker run -p 80 -p 443 nginx`). Fixes [docker/for-win#4935](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/4935) and [docker/compose#6998](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6998).
- Fixed an issue which caused Docker Desktop to crash when resetting to factory defaults while running Windows containers.
- Fixed multiple issues related to Fast Startup.
- Injected Docker CLI, CLI plugins, Docker Compose, Notary, and kubectl into WSL distributions when Docker Desktop WSL integration is enabled.
- Fixed an issue where bind mounts created with Docker Compose from a WSL distribution were incorrectly translated. Fixes [docker/for-win#5084](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5084).
- Docker Desktop now supports inotify events on shared filesystems for Windows file sharing.
- Fixed a cache invalidation bug when a file in a shared volume is renamed on the host for Windows file sharing.
- Fixed a handle leak when calling `Mknod` on a shared volume for Windows file sharing.
- To make VM startup more reliable, Docker Desktop now avoids adding a Hyper-V NIC to the Windows VM when using Hypervisor sockets for Windows file sharing (rather than Samba).

* Bug fixes and minor changes
  - Fixed race condition where Kubernetes sometimes fails to start after the app is restarted.
  - The system tray icon now opens the Docker Desktop menu with left or right mouse button.
  - When displaying the crash report window, Docker Desktop does not send a bugsnag crash report unless the user needs the report to upload diagnostics.
  - Docker Desktop has removed the ability to log in using email address as a username as the Docker command line does not support this.
  - For Linux containers on Windows (LCOW), at least one physical computer running Windows 10 Professional or Windows 10 Enterprise version 1809 or later is required.
  - The `Send usage statistics` checkbox is selected by default in Docker Desktop for Windows (Community). This option cannot be modified.
  - Docker Desktop has added a new dialog box during startup which allows users to retry mounting a shared drive or remove it from the shared drives list after a failed attempt.

  - Fix startup issue with AUFS
  - Fix status bug which could prevent the kubernetes cluster from starting.
  - Fix bug which would cause VM logs to be written to RAM rather than disk in some cases, and the VM to hang.
  - Fix security issue with named pipe connection to docker service.

* Docker for Windows is now available from two channels: **stable** and **beta**. New features and bug fixes go out first in auto-updates to users in the beta channel. Updates to the stable channel are much less frequent and happen in sync with major and minor releases of the Docker Engine. Only features that are well-tested and ready for production are added to the stable channel releases. For downloads of both and more information, see [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](/manuals/desktop/setup/install/windows-install.md).
