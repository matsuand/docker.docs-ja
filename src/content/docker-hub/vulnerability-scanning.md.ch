When you push an image to a Docker Hub repository after turning on static
scanning, Docker Hub automatically scans the image to identify vulnerabilities.
The scan results shows the security state of your images at the time when the
scan was run.

## Changes to static scanning in Docker Hub
@z

@x
From February 27th, 2023, Docker changed the technology that supports the
Docker Hub static scanning feature. The static scanning is now powered natively
by Docker, instead of a third-party.

@z

@x
As a result of this change, scanning now detects vulnerabilities at a more
granular level than before. This in turn means that vulnerability reports may
show a higher number of vulnerabilities. If you used vulnerability scanning
before February 27th, 2023, you may see that new vulnerability reports list a
higher number of vulnerabilities, due to a more thorough analysis.

There is no action required on your part. Scans continue to run as usual
with no interruption or changes to pricing. Historical data continues to be
available.
