@x
The Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) logging driver forwards container logs as ETW events.
ETW stands for Event Tracing in Windows, and is the common framework
for tracing applications in Windows. Each ETW event contains a message
with both the log and its context information. A client can then create
an ETW listener to listen to these events.

@x
The ETW provider that this logging driver registers with Windows, has the
GUID identifier of: `{a3693192-9ed6-46d2-a981-f8226c8363bd}`. A client creates an
ETW listener and registers to listen to events from the logging driver's provider.
It doesn't matter the order in which the provider and listener are created.
A client can create their ETW listener and start listening for events from the provider,
before the provider has been registered with the system.

1. `logman start -ets DockerContainerLogs -p {a3693192-9ed6-46d2-a981-f8226c8363bd} 0 0 -o trace.etl`
2. Run your container(s) with the etwlogs driver, by adding
   `--log-driver=etwlogs` to the Docker run command, and generate log messages.
3. `logman stop -ets DockerContainerLogs`
4. This generates an etl file that contains the events. One way to convert this
   file into human-readable form is to run: `tracerpt -y trace.etl`.

context information. The timestamp is also available within the ETW event.
