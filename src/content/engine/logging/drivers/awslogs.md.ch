The `awslogs` logging driver sends container logs to
[Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/details/#log-monitoring).
Log entries can be retrieved through the [AWS Management
Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs:) or the [AWS SDKs
and Command Line Tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/index.html).

## Usage
@z

@x
To use the `awslogs` driver as the default logging driver, set the `log-driver`
and `log-opt` keys to appropriate values in the `daemon.json` file, which is
located in `/etc/docker/` on Linux hosts or
`C:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json` on Windows Server. For more about
configuring Docker using `daemon.json`, see
[daemon.json](../../../reference/cli/dockerd.md#daemon-configuration-file).
The following example sets the log driver to `awslogs` and sets the
`awslogs-region` option.

@x
The `awslogs-datetime-format` option defines a multi-line start pattern in [Python
`strftime` format](https://strftime.org). A log message consists of a line that
matches the pattern and any following lines that don't match the pattern. Thus
the matched line is the delimiter between log messages.

@x
One example of a use case for using
this format is for parsing output such as a stack dump, which might otherwise
be logged in multiple entries. The correct pattern allows it to be captured in a
single entry.
