Secure computing mode (`seccomp`) is a Linux kernel feature. You can use it to
restrict the actions available within the container. The `seccomp()` system
call operates on the seccomp state of the calling process. You can use this
feature to restrict your application's access.

The default `seccomp` profile provides a sane default for running containers with
seccomp and disables around 44 system calls out of 300+. It is moderately
protective while providing wide application compatibility. The default Docker
profile can be found
[here](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json).

In effect, the profile is an allowlist which denies access to system calls by
default, then allowlists specific system calls. The profile works by defining a
`defaultAction` of `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` and overriding that action only for specific
system calls. The effect of `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` is to cause a `Permission Denied`
error. Next, the profile defines a specific list of system calls which are fully
allowed, because their `action` is overridden to be `SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`. Finally,
some specific rules are for individual system calls such as `personality`, and others, 
to allow variants of those system calls with specific arguments.

Docker's default seccomp profile is an allowlist which specifies the calls that
are allowed. The table below lists the significant (but not all) syscalls that
are effectively blocked because they are not on the Allowlist. The table includes
the reason each syscall is blocked rather than white-listed.
