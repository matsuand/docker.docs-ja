When running Docker Engine in swarm mode, you can use `docker stack deploy` to
deploy a complete application stack to the swarm. The `deploy` command accepts
a stack description in the form of a [Compose file](../../compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3.md).

Because a swarm consists of multiple Docker Engines, a registry is required to
distribute images to all of them. You can use the
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) or maintain your own. Here's how to create
a throwaway registry, which you can discard afterward.
