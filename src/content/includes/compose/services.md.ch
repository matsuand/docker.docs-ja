@x
A service is an abstract definition of a computing resource within an application which can be scaled or replaced
independently from other components. Services are backed by a set of containers, run by the platform
according to replication requirements and placement constraints. As services are backed by containers, they are defined
by a Docker image and set of runtime arguments. All containers within a service are identically created with these
arguments.
