Profiles help you adjust your Compose application for different environments or use cases by selectively activating services. Services can be assigned to one or more profiles; unassigned services start by default, while assigned ones only start when their profile is active. This setup means specific services, like those for debugging or development, to be included in a single `compose.yml` file and activated only as needed.
