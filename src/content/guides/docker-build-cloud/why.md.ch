Docker Build Cloud is a service that lets you build container images faster,
both locally and in CI. Builds run on cloud infrastructure optimally
dimensioned for your workloads, with no configuration required. The service
uses a remote build cache, ensuring fast builds anywhere and for all team
members.

There’s no need to worry about managing builders or infrastructure — simply
connect to your builders and start building. Each cloud builder provisioned to
an organization is completely isolated to a single Amazon EC2 instance, with a
dedicated EBS volume for build cache and encryption in transit. That means
there are no shared processes or data between cloud builders.
