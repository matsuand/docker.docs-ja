- Anyone who wants to tackle common causes of slow image builds: limited local
  resources, slow emulation, and lack of build collaboration across a team.
- Developers working on older machines who want to build faster.
- Development teams working on the same repository who want to cut wait times
  with a shared cache.
- Developers performing multi-architecture builds who don’t want to spend hours
  configuring and rebuilding for emulators.
