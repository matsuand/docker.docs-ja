This guide provides an introduction to building CI pipelines using Docker and
GitHub Actions. You will learn how to use Docker's official GitHub Actions to
build your application as a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub. By the end
of the guide, you'll have a simple, functional GitHub Actions configuration for
Docker builds. Use it as-is, or extend it further to fit your needs.

GitHub Actions workflows define a series of steps to automate tasks, such as
building and pushing Docker images, in response to triggers like commits or
pull requests. In this guide, the workflow focuses on automating Docker builds
and testing, ensuring your containerized application works correctly before
publishing it.
