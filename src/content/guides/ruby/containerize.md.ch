Starting from Rails 7.1 [Docker is supported out of the box](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/7_1_release_notes.html#generate-dockerfiles-for-new-rails-applications). This means that you will get a `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore` and `bin/docker-entrypoint` files generated for you when you create a new Rails application.

If you have an existing Rails application, you will need to create the Docker assets manually. Unfortunately `docker init` command does not yet support Rails. This means that if you are working with Rails, you'll need to copy Dockerfile and other related configurations manually from the examples below.

> Multistage Dockerfiles help create smaller, more efficient images by separating build and runtime dependencies, ensuring only necessary components are included in the final image. Read more in the [Multi-stage builds guide](/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/multi-stage-builds/).

Although the Dockerfile is generated automatically, understanding its purpose and functionality is important. Reviewing the following example is highly recommended.

Besides the two files above you will also need a `.dockerignore` file. This file is used to exclude files and directories from the context of the build. Below is an example of a `.dockerignore` file.

The last optional file that you may want is the `compose.yaml` file, which is used by Docker Compose to define the services that make up the application. Since SQLite is being used as the database, there is no need to define a separate service for the database. The only service required is the Rails application itself.
