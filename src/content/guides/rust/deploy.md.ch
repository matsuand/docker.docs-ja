In your `docker-rust-postgres` directory, create a file named
`docker-rust-kubernetes.yaml`. Open the file in an IDE or text editor and add
the following contents. Replace `DOCKER_USERNAME/REPO_NAME` with your Docker
username and the name of the repository that you created in [Configure CI/CD for
your Rust application](configure-ci-cd.md).

- A Deployment, describing a scalable group of identical pods. In this case,
  you'll get just one replica, or copy of your pod. That pod, which is
  described under `template`, has just one container in it. The container is
  created from the image built by GitHub Actions in [Configure CI/CD for your
  Rust application](configure-ci-cd.md).
- A NodePort service, which will route traffic from port 30001 on your host to
  port 5000 inside the pods it routes to, allowing you to reach your app
  from the network.
