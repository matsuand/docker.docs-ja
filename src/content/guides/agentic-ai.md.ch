Agentic applications are transforming how software gets built. These apps don't
just respond, they decide, plan, and act. They're powered by models,
orchestrated by agents, and integrated with APIs, tools, and services in real
time.

For this guide, you'll start by running the app in Docker Offload, using the
same Compose workflow you're already familiar with. Then, if your machine
hardware supports it, you'll run the same app locally using the same workflow.
Finally, you'll dig into the Compose file, Dockerfile, and app to see how it all
works together.

requirements to run the model locally. Docker Offload includes support for

If your machine meets the necessary hardware requirements, you can run the
entire application stack locally using Docker Compose. This lets you test the
application end-to-end, including the model and MCP gateway, without needing to
run in the cloud. This particular example uses the [Gemma 3 4B
model](https://hub.docker.com/r/ai/gemma3) with a context size of `10000`.

The `adk` web application is an agent implementation that connects to the MCP
gateway and a model through environment variables and API calls. It uses the
[ADK (Agent Development Kit)](https://github.com/google/adk-python) to define a
root agent named Auditor, which coordinates two sub-agents, Critic and Reviser,
to verify and refine model-generated answers.

- Critic: Verifies factual claims using the toolset, such as DuckDuckGo.
- Reviser: Edits answers based on the verification verdicts provided by the Critic.
- Auditor: A higher-level agent that sequences the
  Critic and Reviser. It acts as the entry point, evaluating LLM-generated
  answers, verifying them, and refining the final output.

directory. Here's a breakdown of the notable files:

@x
- `agents/agent.py`: Defines the Auditor, a SequentialAgent that chains together
  the Critic and Reviser agents. This agent is the main entry point of the
  application and is responsible for auditing LLM-generated content using
  real-world verification tools.

- `agents/agent.py`: Defines the Auditor, a SequentialAgent that chains together

  application and is responsible for auditing LLM-generated content using

@z

@x
- `agents/sub_agents/critic/agent.py`: Defines the Critic agent. It loads the
  language model (via Docker Model Runner), sets the agent’s name and behavior,
  and connects to MCP tools (like DuckDuckGo).

- `agents/sub_agents/critic/agent.py`: Defines the Critic agent. It loads the
  language model (via Docker Model Runner), sets the agent’s name and behavior,
  and connects to MCP tools (like DuckDuckGo).

@x
- `agents/sub_agents/critic/prompt.py`: Contains the Critic prompt, which
  instructs the agent to extract and verify claims using external tools.

@x
- `agents/sub_agents/critic/tools.py`: Defines the MCP toolset configuration,
  including parsing `mcp/` strings, creating tool connections, and handling MCP
  gateway communication.

@x
- `agents/sub_agents/reviser/agent.py`: Defines the Reviser agent, which takes
  the Critic’s findings and minimally rewrites the original answer. It also
  includes callbacks to clean up the LLM output and ensure it's in the right
  format.

The MCP gateway is configured via the `MCPGATEWAY_ENDPOINT` environment
variable. In this case, `http://mcp-gateway:8811/sse`. This allows the app to
use Server-Sent Events (SSE) to communicate with the MCP gateway container,
which itself brokers access to external tool services like DuckDuckGo.

Agent-based AI applications are emerging as a powerful new software
architecture. In this guide, you explored a modular, chain-of-thought system
where an Auditor agent coordinates the work of a Critic and a Reviser to
fact-check and refine model-generated answers. This architecture shows how to
combine local model inference with external tool integrations in a structured,
modular way.
