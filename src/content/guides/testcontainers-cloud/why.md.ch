- **Offloading to the Cloud:** Frees up local resources by shifting container management to the cloud, keeping your laptop responsive.
- **Consistent Testing Environments:** Ensures that tests run in isolated, reliable environments, reducing inconsistencies across platforms from Dev to CI.
- **Scalability:** Allows running large numbers of containers simultaneously without being limited by local or CI resources.
- **Faster CI/CD Pipelines:** Reduces configuration bottlenecks and speeds up build times by offloading containers to multiple on-demand cloud workers with the Turbo-mode feature.
