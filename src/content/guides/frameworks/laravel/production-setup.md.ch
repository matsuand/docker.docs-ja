This layout represents a typical Laravel project, with Docker configurations stored in a unified `docker` directory. You’ll find **two** Compose files — `compose.dev.yaml` (for development) and `compose.prod.yaml` (for production) — to keep your environments separate and manageable.

For production, the `php-fpm` Dockerfile creates an optimized image with only the PHP extensions and libraries your application needs. As demonstrated in the [GitHub example](https://github.com/dockersamples/laravel-docker-examples), a single Dockerfile with multi-stage builds maintains consistency and reduces duplication between development and production. The following snippet shows only the production-related stages:
