Logging drivers enables users to forward container logs to another service for
processing. Docker includes several logging drivers as built-ins, however can
never hope to support all use-cases with built-in drivers. Plugins allow Docker
to support a wide range of logging services without requiring to embed client
libraries for these services in the main Docker codebase. See the
[plugin documentation](legacy_plugins.md) for more information.

@x
The main interface for logging plugins uses the same JSON+HTTP RPC protocol used
by other plugin types. See the
[example](https://github.com/cpuguy83/docker-log-driver-test) plugin for a
reference implementation of a logging plugin. The example wraps the built-in
`jsonfilelog` log driver.

`File` is the path to the log stream that needs to be consumed. Each call to
`StartLogging` should provide a different file path, even if it's a container
that the plugin has already received logs for prior. The file is created by
docker with a randomly generated name.

as they come in once the existing logs have been read.
