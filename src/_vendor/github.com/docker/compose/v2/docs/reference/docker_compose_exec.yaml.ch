@x
command: docker compose exec
short: Execute a command in a running container

    This is the equivalent of `docker exec` targeting a Compose service.

@x
    With this subcommand, you can run arbitrary commands in your services. Commands allocate a TTY by default, so
    you can use a command such as `docker compose exec web sh` to get an interactive prompt.

@x
    By default, Compose will enter container in interactive mode and allocate a TTY, while the equivalent `docker exec`
    command requires passing `--interactive --tty` flags to get the same behavior. Compose also support those two flags
    to offer a smooth migration between commands, whenever they are no-op by default. Still, `interactive` can be used to
    force disabling interactive mode (`--interactive=false`), typically when `docker compose exec` command is used inside
    a script.
